# Project-FIFA-Data-Analysi

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of FIFA player data using Python. The dataset used here is the FIFA 15 Players dataset, exploring various attributes of football players such as age, potential, wage, goals scored, and more.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries mentioned above.
2. Download the 'players_15.csv' dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12uoccfVCnxmA_KeB5gk_ytlQQINz7kJs/view?usp=sharing).
3. Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred environment.
4. Explore the FIFA dataset analysis insights.

## Contents
1. **Youngest, Oldest Player**: Identify the youngest and oldest player in the dataset.
2. **Player with the Highest Wage**: Determine the player with the highest wage.
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Find and remove duplicate entries from the dataset.
4. **Top 10 Players based on Potential**: List out the top 10 players based on their potential.
5. **New DataFrame Creation**: Create a new DataFrame with two columns - 'Name' and 'POT' (Potential).
6. **Visualization**: Plotting the potential of the top 10 players.
7. **Player with the Highest Number of Goals**: Find the player who has scored the highest number of goals.
8. **Players with Potential ≥ 90**: Find all players whose potential is 90 or greater.
9. **Players with Potential ≥ 90 and Age < 20**: Find players with potential greater than or equal to 90 and age less than 20.
10. **Players with Value > 10 and Wage < 52**: Find players whose value is greater than 10 but wage is less than 52.
11. **Heatmap**: Visualize the correlation between various player attributes using a heatmap.
